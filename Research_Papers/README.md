### Abstract

Modern AI systems excel at perception tasks yet continue to struggle with general-purpose reasoning and interpretability, two pillars of trustworthy, human-aligned intelligence. In this work, we introduce **NeuroLogicX**, a modular neurosymbolic framework that integrates symbolic logic with deep learning to enable scalable, interpretable, and reusable reasoning. NeuroLogicX cleanly separates perception, reasoning, and explanation into independent modules, each connected via transparent interfaces. This design enables symbolic rules to guide and interact with neural representations, supporting both logical rigor and adaptive learning. We demonstrate theoretical architecture, practical implementation using tools like PyTorch and Prolog, and application potential in healthcare, finance, and legal AI.

### Code Snippets (Highlights)

- **Predicate Conversion:**
  ```python
  def neural_to_predicate(entity: str, prediction: str) -> str:
      return f"{prediction.lower()}({entity})"
  
  	•	Rule Chaining Logic:
  rules = {"cat": "mammal", "mammal": "animal"}
def rule_chain(predicate: str, max_depth=3):
    chain = [predicate]
    for _ in range(max_depth):
        next_pred = rules.get(chain[-1])
        if not next_pred:
            break
        chain.append(next_pred)
    return chain

    	•	Predicate Scorer (PyTorch):
     class PredicateScorer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(dim, 1)
    def forward(self, emb):
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc(emb))

        	•	Explainability Gradient:
         from captum.attr import Saliency
saliency = Saliency(model)
grads = saliency.attribute(input_tensor)

Evaluation Strategy

Theoretical Evaluation:
	•	Modularity testing via component replacement.
	•	Interpretability tracing using logical chains.
	•	Expressiveness of multi-hop reasoning and probabilistic logic.

Experimental Evaluation (Planned):
	•	Benchmarking on CLEVR, bAbI, OpenBookQA.
	•	Baseline comparison: DeepProbLog, NeuroSAT, Logic Tensor Networks.
	•	Metrics: accuracy, explainability, modular robustness.

Future Work & Open Challenges
	•	Building dynamic neural-to-symbolic translators using LLMs.
	•	Rule induction from noisy or unstructured data.
	•	Improving runtime inference speed and symbolic confidence calibration.
	•	Developing adaptive symbolic rule generation and meta-reasoning.
	•	Building a full working prototype with Streamlit-based UI.
